        <strong>Nobody’s born smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        <strong>Slowly. Surely</strong>. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        <em>One foot in front of the other.</em> One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most <em>beautiful, complex</em> concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
